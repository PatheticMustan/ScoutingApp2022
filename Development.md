# Development

A guide for adding to this app, or modifying it to a new year.
The app has been designed to be extremely easy to re-use, adding new buttons should take seconds,
and changing the exports spreadsheet is trivial.

First, make sure you [set up your development environment](./Usage.md). 

Here's a list of important things you should note!
- [/Components/Buttons](./Components/Buttons), which includes most of the buttons you'll need.
- [/Components/Utility/CustomTextBox.js](./Components/Utility/CustomTextBox.js), for any text input.
- [/Components/Utility/GridArena.js](/Components/Utility/GridArena.js), our custom way of placing components on the arena easily.
- [/Config/kpvToCsv.js](./Config/kpvToCsv.js), the exports config file.
- [/Routes/ScoutComponents](/Routes/ScoutComponents), the actual scout page you'll need to update.
